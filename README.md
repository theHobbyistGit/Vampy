# Vampy
My first Testproject called Vampy

What is Vampy?

Well Vampy is a small project to simply generate Character and NPC sheets for the 20th Anniversary Edition of Vampire the Masquerade and stores them into a database where the storyteller can quickly search for player or NPC stats.

Which features will be included?

This is not easy to say because most of the ideas for features will come while programming.
But the first things that are coming to my mind are the following:

- A web based program to store character sheets in.
- NPC sheets are stored as well.
- The characters and NPC should belong to a chronicle.

If i have fun with this project i would let it grow and build in stuff like:

- chronicles and their belongings are visible to certain users (userrights implementation).
- English language support
- Styling of the GUI to make it look sexy
- And many more features ;-)
